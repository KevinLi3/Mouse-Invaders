# Mouse-Invaders

A space-invader style shooter (still in progress) made using Python and Pygame. Will add power-ups, levels, and highscore in the future. This was my "introduction to pygame project" made for the purpose of familiarizing myself with the various pygame features and just as a fun thing to do in my spare time. Upon completion, I plan on releasing a mobile verson.
